            <p>
                The origami crane is one of the most celebrated paper folding projects of all time. It's often the first
                project that beginning paper folders learn how to make once they decide they're interested in origami.
            </p>

            <p>
                The origami crane motif is so popular that it can be found on paintings, posters, wall decals, trinket
                boxes, and T-shirts. Some people even get origami crane tattoos to symbolize peace and harmony.
            </p>


            <p>
                The origami crane is created using a bird base. A bird base is a square base plus two petal folds.

                To turn your square base into a bird base, fold the top left and right flaps into the center and unfold.
                Fold the top of the model downward to create a horizontal fold that connects the diagonal folds you just
                made. Crease well, and then unfold. When you are finished, your paper should look like the photo to the
                left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open the upper flap, pressing the sides of the model inwards at the same time. Flatten down, creasing
                well. When you are finished, your crane should look like the photo to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                To complete the bird base, turn the model over and repeat the petal folds in Step 3 and 4 on the other
                side.

                An origami crane begins with a square base. Place your paper colored side up. Fold in half diagonally
                and open. Then fold in half along the diagonal the other way. Turn the paper over to the opposite side.
                Fold the paper in half, crease well and open. Then, fold again in the other direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the creases you have just made, bring the top three corners down toward the bottom of the paper.
                Flatten the model to complete your square base.
            </p>
